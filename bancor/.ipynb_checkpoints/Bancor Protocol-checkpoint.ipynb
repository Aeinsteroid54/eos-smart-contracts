    "### Definitions and notes on the Bancor Algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $TOK$ is the your native Smart Token symbol, which could be HORUS for example\n",
    "* $CTOK$ is the connector token that you wish to transfer, which could be EOS, BTC, or even ETH, if desired.\n",
    "* [USD/TOK] the brakets indicate only the units of the variable, in this case the unit is USD/TOK\n",
    "* From the whitepaper, \"The price of a Smart Token is denominated in the connected token (for example, the price of BNT is denominated in ETH, its connected token\"\n",
    "* 'The bancor formula is built upon the idea that the smart contract maintains a ratio between the total value and the connector valance, the connector weight.'\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Connector Weight\n",
    "From the Price Formula algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ CW = \\frac{CTOKbalance [CTOK]}{TOKmarketcap [CTOK]}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$TOKmarketCap [CTOK]= price [CTOK/TOK]*TotalTOKSupply[TOK]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where, $CTOKbalance$ is the balance of the tokens in the connector account and $TOKmarketcap$ is the market cap of the Smart token implementing the Bancor algorithm. Since $CW$ is a unitless ratio between 0-1, and $TOKmarketcap$ is in units of [], then $CTOKbalance$ must also be in units of [USD].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $price$ is in units of [USD/TOK] and $totalTOKsupply$ is the maximum amount of $TOK$ tokens created by the smart contract.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few small notes: \n",
    " * The whitepaper states that: \"The CW is expressed as a percentage greater than 0% and up to 100%, and as mentioned, is initially set by the creator when a Smart Token is configured.\" \n",
    " \n",
    "If this were true, and $CTOKbalance$ and $TOKmarketcap$ are of the same units, than the equation for $CW$ would have to be:*\n",
    "$$ CW [\\%]= \\frac{CTOKbalance [CTOK]}{TOKmarketcap [CTOK]}*100$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Token Price\n",
    "Solve for the Smart Token's price as a function of it's connector weight, $CW$, connector balance, $CTOKbalance$, and Smart Token supply, $TOKsupply$.  The $Smart Token Outstanding Supply$ is not defined in the Bancor whitepaper, but we're assuming it represents available supply of $TOK$ to the smart contract, $TOKsupply$. This $TOKsupply$ would have to be a liquid balance of $TOK$, owned by the Smart Contract administrators, to be usefully traded.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Whitepaper defines an algorithm for determining the Smart Token's price as a function of the $CTOKbalance$ and the $CW$. Since $CTOKbalance$ and $TOKsupply$ are in units of [USD] (or any other fiat currency), the $price$ variable is unitless and will range between 0-1.0. This also agrees with the units of the $effective price$ described later in the paper. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ price [CTOK/TOK] = \\frac{CTOKBalance [CTOK]}{TOKsupply [TOK]*CW}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This formula implies that if there is a large outstanding supply (low demand), the token will be worth a fraction of it's marketcap price and if only a few tokens are available in supply (high demand), each token will be worth nearly the marketcap price.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Another note: \n",
    "Since $CW$ is:\n",
    "$$ CW = \\frac{CTOKbalance [CTOK]}{TOKmarketcap [CTOK]}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ price = \\frac{CTOKBalance [CTOK]}{TOKsupply [TOK]*CW}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ price = \\frac{CTOKBalance [CTOK]}{TOKsupply [TOK]*\\frac{CTOKbalance [CTOK]}{TOKmarketcap [CTOK]}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ price [CTOK/TOK] = \\frac{TOKmarketcap [CTOK]}{TOKsupply [TOK]}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tokens Issued \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ TOKissued [TOK] = TOKsupply [TOK]*\\big((1+(\\frac{CTOKrecieved [CTOK]}{CTOKbalance [CTOK]})^{CW}-1\\big)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the amount of Smart Tokens to payout given the current smart token supply, $TOKsupply$, the connected tokens paid, $CTOKrecieved$, and the balance of $CTOK$ tokens in the bancor account, $CTOKbalance$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ CTOKissued = CTOKbalance * ((1+ \\frac{TOKrecieved}{TOKsupply})^{\\frac{1}{CW}}-1) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The effective price can be calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ effectivePrice  [CTOK/TOK] = \\frac{CTOKexchanged [CTOK]}{TOKexchanged [TOK]}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The $effectivePrice$ represents the effective exchange rate of the transaction, in units of $[CTOK/TOK]$\n",
